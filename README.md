This project contains a Verilog implementation of an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The ALU performs a range of arithmetic and logic operations including addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left and right shifts, increment, decrement, and basic comparison checks. The design is modular, easy to understand, and suitable for both educational and practical digital design purposes. A testbench is included to simulate and verify the functionality of the ALU using standard Verilog simulation tools.
